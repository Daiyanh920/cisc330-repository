1. What do the id and class attributes do? How are they alike and different?
Id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. Class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. 
The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. For class attributes multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

2. What are the parts of a CSS rule?
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

3. Explain how CSS rules cascade.
When there's 2 or more rules applying to the same element the important keyword will trump anything. 
If there are 2 or more rules pointing to the same element, the selector will choose the one that has the highest specificity. 
Thereâ€™s inheritance which is a child element that inherits the properties of a parent element. The last one is when 2 or more 
rules are pointed to the same element and they are equal,  the rule applied last will come out first. 

4. Contrast display: block, inline, inline-block.
Block displays a block element, and it starts on a new line that takes up the whole width. Inline displays an inline element, 
and the width and height properties will have no effect. Inline-block displays an inline block container and you can apply the 
width and height values. 

5. What are border, padding, and margin?
Borders separate the edge of one box from another. Padding is the space between the border of a box and 
any content contained within it. Margin is the outside part of the border to keep a gap between the borders and elements.
