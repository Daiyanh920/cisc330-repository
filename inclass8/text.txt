1. In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, called the interpreter, reads and executes the code. This is called an Interpreted language. 
2. Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime, this is called dynamic typing. 
3. The automatic conversion of values from one data type to another is called Type juggling
4. Primitive data types are mutable and hold references to objects stored in memory. 
5. Strict Equal Checks if two values are equal without type coercion.
