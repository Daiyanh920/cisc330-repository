1. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different? 
Flexbox and CSS Grid are both layout systems in CSS, but they differ in purpose. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout
 system, meaning it works in either a row or a column, making it great for aligning items along a single axis. In 
 contrast, CSS Grid is two-dimensional, allowing precise control over both rows and columns, making it better suited for complex layouts.

2. Whatâ€™s responsive design in web development and how do we implement it? 
Responsive design ensures that websites adapt to different screen sizes for better usability on mobile, tablet, 
and desktop devices. It is implemented using CSS media queries, flexible layouts, and the viewport meta tag. This 
approach improves accessibility and enhances the user experience across various devices.
