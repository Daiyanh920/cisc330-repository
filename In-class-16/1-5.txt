1. a website can tell a browser to store data about the user and their visit in a text file called a Cookie 
2. each time the browser requests another page from that domain, the browser sends the data in the cookie back to the Server
3. browsers only send data in a cookie to a server when it is requesting data from the same Domain that set it 
4. Sessions store information about a user and their preferences on the Server. 5. Exceptions are thrown - they are intended to be caught. Errors are generally unrecoverable
